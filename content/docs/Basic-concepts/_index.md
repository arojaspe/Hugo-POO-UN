## What is the structure of OOP?

The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming include the following:

### Classes

Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes, and methods. They define the structure and behavior of objects.

### Objects

Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. They represent real-world objects or abstract entities. When a class is initially defined, the description is the only object that is defined. Objects have their own state and behavior.

### Methods

Methods are functions that are defined inside a class to describe the behaviors of an object. Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object. Methods allow objects to perform actions and interact with other objects. They provide the functionality and behavior of objects.

### Attributes

Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object. Objects have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself and are shared by all instances of the class. Attributes define the properties and characteristics of objects.
