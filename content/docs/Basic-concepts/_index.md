## Structure of OOP

The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming include the following:


### Classes
---
A class is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). It serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects, which are instances of the class. A class defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.
 
### Objects

---
Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. They represent real-world objects or abstract entities. When a class is initially defined, the description is the only object that is defined. Objects have their own state and behavior.

### Methods

---
Methods are functions that are defined inside a class to describe the behaviors of an object. Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object. Methods allow objects to perform actions and interact with other objects. They provide the functionality and behavior of objects.

### Attributes

---
Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object. Objects have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself and are shared by all instances of the class. Attributes define the properties and characteristics of objects.
