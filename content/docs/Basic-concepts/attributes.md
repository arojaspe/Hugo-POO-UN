## Attributes in Object-Oriented Programming

Attributes, also known as properties or fields, are the characteristics or data associated with an object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They represent the state of an object and define its behavior.

### Example: Bank Account Class

Let's delve into the concept of attributes using the example of a `BankAccount`.

#### Attributes Concept:

Attributes are characteristics or properties that describe the objects created from a class. In our example, a bank account object would have various attributes that define its state, such as `account_number`, `balance`, and `account_holder`.

### Bank Account Attributes:

Consider the attributes of a bank account object:

- **Account Number**:
  - This attribute uniquely identifies each bank account.
  - Example: `123456789`

- **Balance**:
  - This attribute represents the amount of money currently in the bank account.
  - Example: `$1000`

- **Account Holder**:
  - This attribute specifies the name of the person who owns the bank account.
  - Example: `John Doe`

### Bank Account Class:

When we define the `BankAccount` class, we specify these attributes as part of its structure. Each bank account object created from this class will have its own set of attribute values, allowing us to differentiate between different accounts.

For instance, if we create a bank account object for John Doe, it will have an `account_number` of `123456789`, a `balance` of `$1000`, and an `account_holder` name of `John Doe`. These attributes collectively describe the state of the bank account object.
