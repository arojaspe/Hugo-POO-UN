### Methods in Object-Oriented Programming

Methods are an essential part of object-oriented programming (OOP). They are functions that are associated with a specific class or object and are used to perform actions or provide behavior for that class or object.

### Example: Bank Account Class

Let's say we have a class called `BankAccount`. This class represents a bank account, and it has methods to perform banking operations like depositing money and withdrawing money.

#### Depositing Money:

- **Method Name:** `deposit`
- **What it does:** Adds money to the bank account.
- **For Example:** If you want to put $100 into your bank account, you would use the `deposit` method.

#### Withdrawing Money:

- **Method Name:** `withdraw`
- **What it does:** Takes money out of the bank account, but only if there's enough money in the account.
- **For Example:** If you want to take out $50 from your bank account, you would use the `withdraw` method. But if you only have $30 in your account, you can't withdraw $50 because you don't have enough money.

### Bank Account Operations

Let's walk through some simple operations you can do with your bank account:

#### Depositing Funds:

- You get your paycheck and want to put $500 into your bank account. You'd use the `deposit` method to add $500 to your account balance.

#### Withdrawing Funds:

- You need to pay your monthly bills, so you withdraw $200 from your bank account. You'd use the `withdraw` method to take out $200 from your account balance. But if you try to withdraw $500 when you only have $300 in your account, you can't do it because you don't have enough money.
