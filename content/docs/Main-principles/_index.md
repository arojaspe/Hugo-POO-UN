## Main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information or functionality. It helps in achieving data abstraction and provides better control over the data.

2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class. It promotes code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchical structure of classes.

3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects, providing flexibility and extensibility.

4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction focuses on representing the essential features of an object, while hiding the unnecessary details. It helps in managing complexity and simplifies the development process.

These principles form the foundation of OOP and are essential for building modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
