A class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. A class is like a blueprint for an object. \
Imagine we have a Class called "GameCharacter." Within the vast world of gaming, there can be a multitude of different characters, each with unique names, appearances, and abilities.\
However, despite their individuality, they often share certain common characteristics and behaviors that define what it means to be a "GameCharacter."In this scenario, "GameCharacter" is the Class, and the shared attributes and behaviors are its properties. These properties could include fundamental aspects such as "Health Points," "Attack Power," "Movement Speed," and "Special Abilities." \
Regardless of whether a GameCharacter is a heroic knight, a cunning rogue, or a powerful wizard, they all possess these core properties
