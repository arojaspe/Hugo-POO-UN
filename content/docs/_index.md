## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model that arranges software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. In this approach, an object is defined as a data field with unique attributes and behavior.

OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate, rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach is particularly useful for large, complex programs that require constant updates or maintenance. Areas of application include manufacturing and design programs, as well as mobile applications. For example, OOP can be applied to develop manufacturing system simulation software.

## What is the structure of object-oriented programming?

The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming include the following:

## [Classes](poo-concepts/basic-concepts/class.md)

Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes, and methods. 

---

## [Objects](poo-concepts/basic-concepts/object.md)

Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity. When a class is initially defined, the description is the only object that is defined.

---

## [Methods](poo-concepts/basic-concepts/methods.md)

Methods are functions that are defined inside a class to describe the behaviors of an object. Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object. Additionally, the subroutines contained in an object are called instance methods. Programmers use methods for reusability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time.

---

## [Attributes](POO-concepts/basic-concepts/attributes.md)

Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object. Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself.
